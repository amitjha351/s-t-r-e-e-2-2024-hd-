                Stree 2 picks up years after the events of the first film, with
                Chanderi seemingly at peace after Stree's departure. However, a
                new threat emerges in the form of "Sarkata," a headless ghost
                who abducts women, dragging them into a terrifying alternate
                dimension. Vicky, Bittu, and Rudra must once again team up to
                save the town, this time facing a more formidable and sinister
                foe.

                While the film draws inspiration from Indian folklore and the
                belief in supernatural entities, Stree 2 is a fictional
                narrative. It takes creative liberties with the concept of
                vengeful spirits and incorporates elements of humor and social
                commentary.

                Kapoor adds a touch of mystique and allure to the narrative.

                the Maddock Supernatural Universe, a shared cinematic universe
                created by Maddock Films. Characters from Bhediya, including
                Varun Dhawan as Bhaskar, make appearances in Stree 2, further
                solidifying the connection between these films. This crossover

                No, Stree 2 is not yet available to stream. Stree 2 will
                eventually be available to stream on Disney+. It was recently
                reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before
                landing on Disney+. If Stree 2 arrives on Disney+ exactly 100
                days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel
                will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date
                is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the movie will end
                up on the service a few days before or a few days after said
                date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming
                platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+
                Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+
                Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or
                $139.99/year.

                Folks can also look forward to other cinematic releases this
                early summer. Most recently, the psychological horror flick The
                Watchers premiered on June 7. Previously, the film was pushed
                back to June 14, originally sharing the same release date as
                Stree 2. However, The Watchers eventually returned to its
                initial June 7 date. Marking Ishana Night Shyamalan’s
                directorial debut, The Watchers follows a 28-year-old Mina
                (Dakota Fanning) who finds herself stranded in the uncharted
                woodlands of western Ireland, only to end up becoming pretty to
                deadly forest creatures the human eye can’t see.
